<center>Truth Table Generator</center>

## About Project :

- " Truth table generator " is a desktop app which  generates the truth table for propositional logic formulas. 

- It uses Graphical User Interface (GUI) and is created using Java programming language in NetBeans IDE. 

- It takes input from the user as a boolean expression which is entered in the text field and, the conditional and boolean operations like AND, OR, NOT, implies, XOR, etc. 
  are entered using buttons by the user. 

- The output of this tool is a truth table with truth values 0 and 1 along with True (T) or False (F) values to indicate whether the argument is  tautology or a contradiction. 

- This application can work on any IDE platform. Being Dynamic in nature, it allows user interaction via Swing components like Buttons, Text boxes. 

- And a Pop up window is for the user to enter input while running the project and output to be displayed.

- We may not sketch out a truth table in our everyday lives, but we still use the logical reasoning that truth tables are built from to evaluate 
  whether statements are true or false. 

- Let's say we are told 'If it is raining outside, then the football game is cancelled.' 

- We can use logical reasoning rules to evaluate if the statement is true or false and maybe make some backup plans! 

- This application uses Boolean expressions of any kind that use Operands and Operators (AND, OR, NOT, XOR, NAND, etc.) thereby dealing with logic states in a discrete way.

- Truth table generator app finds its uses and applications in real life scenarios. For instance, students use it to understand, analyze and to examine their arguments.

- It's vastly used in the field of Machine learning to test and train data models and predict future outcomes as a result. 

- It is also used in production and gaming industry as well.
